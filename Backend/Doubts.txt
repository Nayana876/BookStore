1. Generating Controllers with Dependatant tables (primary key and foreign key) in odata config 
2. Hpw to import tables into MODEL with table having Primary key (col1, col2) in both api and odata models
3. Was not able to send an entity back to the front end becuase it was associated with other entities and had infinite self rederencing loops.

	Well the correct answer for the default Json formater based on Json.net is to set ReferenceLoopHandling to Ignore.

	Just add this to the Application_Start in Global.asax:

		HttpConfiguration config = GlobalConfiguration.Configuration;

		config.Formatters.JsonFormatter
            	.SerializerSettings
            	.ReferenceLoopHandling = Newtonsoft.Json.ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore;
	This is the correct way. It will ignore the reference pointing back to the object.

	Other responses focused in changing the list being returned by excluding data or by making a facade object and sometimes that is not an option.

	Using the JsonIgnore attribute to restrict the references can be time consuming and if you want to serialize the tree starting from another point that will be a problem.
